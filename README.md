Aerial detection of HVAC systems (Case Study for Grande Data Services)

Contains:
- Assessment of Grande Data labeler performance
- Training of a custom object detection model using GroundingDino as a base
    - Text prompt tuning based on multi-run zero-shot performance and automatic LLM (ChatGPT) prompt reselection
    - Object detection reranking based on supervised learning from the zero-shot last hidden layer

Results: 
- Dramatically improved object detection performance of rooftop HVAC systems based training from only 120 labeled images
